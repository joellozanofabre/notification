The application is implemented as a modular monolith using Hexagonal Architecture and Domain-Driven Design principles.

This approach allows fast development while keeping clear boundaries between domain, application, and infrastructure layers.

Event-driven communication using Apache Kafka is used to decouple notification creation from delivery, enabling future scalability and easy evolution into microservices if required.
